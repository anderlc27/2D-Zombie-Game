# 2D Zombie Game
This is a 2D game created using p5.js libraries. The game will immediately begin when launched. The goal is to kill as many zombies as possible before the timer runs out. 

## Technical Description
The program uses the p5.js libraries to manipulate the web-browser canvas such that a player can control the primary sprite(left and right arrow keys) and shoot(space-bar) the zombies as they come from the left and right side of the screen. The sprites of the game and the ball that is shot by the player are generated via class-implementation.

## Project Background
This project came about because I wanted to learn the basics of JavaScript. I found the p5.js library to be very user friendly and a great way to introduce programmers to the scripting language. After learning about creating classes with my Battleship project, I found that it would be beneficial to create classes for all components of the game to make manipulation much easier. Overall, upon completing the project, I gained a good introduction to JavaScript.
